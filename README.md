*Some sort of a boilerplate for codeigniter.com css*

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/61d27498-9558-4c69-b281-96892cc1c0c4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/codeigniter-website/deploys)

This repo is the static version {*here:* [https://codeigniter-website.netlify.com](https://codeigniter-website.netlify.com)} of the rendered HTML and CSS from codeigniter.com website. 

Anyway, i'll try some stuff out and push it back on Netlify.

-- Long live **CodeIgniter**! --
