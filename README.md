# codeigniterSandbox

This repo is the static version of the rendered HTML and CSS of the official codeigniter.com website. I made it as I noticed some needed CSS fixes, and cloning that repo will be a good canvas to test fixes or style concepts without messing around in the Chrome DevTools.

The main actual thing to fix as for now, will be the navbar menu items overlapping on mobile. Anyway, i'll try some stuff out for the pleasure and push it back here on Github.

-- Long live *CodeIgniter*! --
